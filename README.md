## Overview
This project analyzes flight price data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.  
Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we clean and process the data, perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and visualize key findings to understand the factors that impact flight prices.

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess flight datasets  
- Explore flight price distribution and patterns  
- Analyze routes, airlines, and timings affecting fares  
- Visualize insights with clear charts and graphs  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter
